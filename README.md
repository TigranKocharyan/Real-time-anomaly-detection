# Anomaly Detection in Data Streams

## Project Overview
This project simulates a continuous data stream and implements anomaly detection algorithms. The generated data consists of a seasonal component, random noise, and occasional anomalies. The project visualizes the data stream both in a complete view and in real-time, highlighting any detected anomalies.

## Features
- **Data Generation**: Synthetic data streams with seasonal patterns and random noise.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implements a sliding window method using Z-scores to detect anomalies.
- **Visualization**: Provides both static and live visualizations of the data stream and detected anomalies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
